## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Building this project with tailwind CSS was simple and just added some drop-shadow. With this project we will get more familiar with the usage of grid and flex
